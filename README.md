# Job-Portal
A job portal webpage is an online platform that connects job seekers with employers. It serves as a centralized hub where companies can post job vacancies, and individuals can search and apply for relevant positions. Job portals streamline the job search and recruitment process, making it more efficient for both employers and job seekers.
